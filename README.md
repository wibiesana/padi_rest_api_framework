## 🌾 Why Padi?

Padi REST API was born out of a desire for a **lean, zero-bloat experience**. We believe that building professional APIs shouldn't require fighting through layers of unnecessary framework complexity. Padi is explicitly designed to bridge the gap between developer productivity and enterprise-scale performance.

- **🪶 Ultra-Lightweight & Zero-Bloat**: Built with a "lean-and-mean" philosophy, Padi eliminates the heavy overhead and hidden "magic" of traditional frameworks. Every line of code exists to serve your API's performance, ensuring minimal latency and maximum clarity.
- **🚀 Uncompromising Performance**: Native support for **FrankenPHP Worker Mode** delivers speeds up to 10x faster than conventional PHP by keeping the application state optimized in memory.
- **🐘 Modern & Future-Ready**: Fully compatible with **PHP 8.4+** standards, utilizing the latest language enhancements for robust, type-safe, and clean codebases.
- **⚙️ Stateless & Worker-Optimized**: A purpose-built core structure that is safe from memory leaks, specifically engineered to excel in long-lived execution environments like high-traffic workers.
- **🛠️ Developer Experience First**: With our powerful **Auto CRUD Generator**, you can transform a simple database schema into a production-ready API with full documentation in seconds.
- **🗄️ Database Agnostic**: Seamlessly switch or scale between MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite without ever needing to rewrite your core business logic.
